## Planned things:
* Landing page (duh)
* About section
* Project section (include Chromebook connected with an employee login(lowest level(or even add a view only)) include upcoming projects (chat app, gonna start that again. Maybe come up with another project to work on as well)
* Skills section(or add it to About)
* 

## Need to decide:
* To framework or not to framework, if framework, which one. Kinda don't wanna use React again, should "expand my horizions" right?
* Decide if i want the website to be page based or scroll based, ie: click the "about" link, do i want it to load a whole new page, or just scroll down to the about section.
* Do i want anything else?
*
